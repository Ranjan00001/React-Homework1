# IIInsener - React Chat Bot

**IIInsener** is a React-based chat interface designed to simulate conversations with a simple bot. It mimics the feel of popular messaging platforms like Discord and Slack, allowing users to send messages and receive real-time responses from a text-transforming bot.

## Features
- **Interactive Chat**: Type messages and send them to the bot with an intuitive interface.
- **Bot Transformations**: The bot randomly applies text transformations like counting characters, reversing text, capitalizing words, and more.
- **Sleek Design**: Styled chat interface with clear distinction between user and bot messages.
- **Real-Time Responses**: The bot responds to messages after a brief delay, enhancing the chat experience.
